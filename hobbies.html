    <h3> My Hobbies but trying to nest to see if I understand how the format works.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Reading Books</li>
        <ul> 
            <li> Depends on the book, sometimes I cant finish half of it. </li>
            <li> Before I despise romance genre coz it promotes idealism but I started liking it after seeing lots of love story vids in tiktok</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Playing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cathrynrdeg/videos/639283864235241">Dota</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam </a> Games</li>
        <ul> 
            <li> I only play Pos4 or Pos5 coz I can't handle playing core - such a noob.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I can't stop myself from trashtalking. Apparently the game made me a toxic player. Laughs.</li>
        </ul>
        <li> Playing instruments</li>
        <ul> 
            <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/nadine.christie/videos/10150380342399588">Guitar</a></li>
            <li> Ukulele</li>
            <li> Piano</li>
            <p><em>But guess what I only know the basics and can't play complicated chords coz when I tried learning guitar during the pandemic I eventually lost interest coz it's not exciting to learn guitar online!</p>
            </em></p>
        </ul>
    </ol>
